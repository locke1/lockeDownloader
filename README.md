# lockeDownloader
Extremely simple youtube-to-mp3 downloader takes a link as a command line argument and downloads mp3 with thumbnail inserted as artwork. Lots of credit goes to Aman Roy: https://github.com/aman-roy/mp3_downloader.
I have simplified their code to run on a link automatically and to not prompt the user for options.

youtube-dl
